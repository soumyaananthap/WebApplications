<p>Synopsis: A 9-year-old boy looks down and his pants are wet and there is a puddle between his legs; he has peed his pants. This is an awful situation for any person to be in, but just when he thought this was the worst day in his life, Susie slips and spills a fish bowl of water right in the boy's lap. The boy is so happy that no one noticed before the water got spilt on him.

This shows kids that we all have bad days and it is important to remember to have empathy at all times.</p>

But where to start? Then it hit him. He opened his eyes in the dark and said, "Let there be light."</p>
